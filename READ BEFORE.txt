Hi,

AllCode.R is main code for this project

NCIS.R
NCIS:LA.R
Suits.R

Those three are combined into an R Script called AllCode.R

There is an error with RStudio it's self as some code does not get scrapped when running all the code at once. 
You will have to run line by line to get all data scrapped. It's a hassle, I know.

There is also pictures of the MapReduce results in the folder in which you will see the commands I used to
gather all Top20 Data. 

Regards,
Kevin Carmody
